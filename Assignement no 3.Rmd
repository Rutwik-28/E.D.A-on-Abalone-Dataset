PROBLEM STATEMENT:
          Download Abalone dataset. (URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) Data set has total 8 Number of Attributes.
Load the data from data file and split it into training and test datasets. Summarize the properties in the training dataset. The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem. Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements using linear regression or predict ring class as classification problem

Read the data
```{r cars}
dataFull <- read.csv(file.choose(),header = TRUE)

```

View the data
```{r}
View(dataFull)
```
Splitting the Data In Test and Train Dataset
```{r}


dataTest = dataFull [(nrow(dataFull)-10):nrow(dataFull),]
dataTrain = dataFull [1: (nrow(dataFull)-11),]
View(dataTest)
View(dataTrain)


```

removing the unecessary Attributes from the dataset

```{r}
dataTest2 <- subset (dataTest, select = -c(Viscera.weight,Whole.weight,Length))
dataTrain2 <- subset (dataTest, select = -c(Viscera.weight,Whole.weight,Length))
```


Train model using LR

```{r}
model2<-lm(Rings~Sex+Diameter+Height+Shucked.weight+Shell.weight, data=dataTrain2)
```


installing jtool

```{r}

install.packages("jtools")
library(jtools)
summ(model2 , confint = TRUE , vifs = T)
```
```{r}
c<- data.frame(Diameter = 0.4, Height= 0.2, Shucked.weight = 0.3, Shell.weight =0.3, Sex = 'F')
 c.rings <- predict(model2, c, interval="prediction", confidence = 0.9)
cat("This adult female abalone is predicted to be approximately", round(c.rings[1]*1.5,digits=2), "years old.")
```
